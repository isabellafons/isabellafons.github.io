                    <br>

                    <p class="lead mb-5">
                      The Language Acquisition, Processing, and Pedagogy Lab at Carnegie Mellon
                      investigates issues related to second language learning, especially the
                       second language learning of tonal languages. The project I focused on
                       was a video game that was designed to investigate the incidental learning
                        of non-native speech catergories.
                    </p>

                    <br><h3 class="mb-1">Data Analysis</h3>

                    <p class = "lead mb-5">
                      Because of the large amounts of data collected during video gameplay, many
                      important pieces of data needed to be extracted and be made easier to analyze.
                      During this project,  I was tasked with creating two R programs: one that could
                      pull gameplay times from a start and end time, and one that mapped user IDs to
                      gameplay IDs, which were different.
                    </p>
                    <br><h3 class="mb-1">Experiment Observation</h3>
                    <p class = "lead mb-5">
                      Numerous participants would come in over the summer to complete 4 tests so
                      that their tonal language learning capabilities could be tested.  I helped with
                      running these experiments, including setting up the sound booth in which the tests
                       were run, running the computer software, and debriefing participants at the end.
                    </p>

                    <br><h3 class="mb-1"> Conclusion </h3>
                    <p class = "lead mb-5">
                    Overall, I am happy I had the experience over the summer to participate in a research
                     project over the summer, and I am especially content with the fact that I was
                     able to use R in a “real-life” setting. This project showed me how much data and s
                     tatistics matters in every field—including unique fields such as modern languages.
                     I had a great experience at the LAPP lab, and I cannot wait to see the outcomes that
                     the video game has on second language acquisition!
